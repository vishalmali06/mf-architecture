            <p>
                This Shipping / Delivery Policy explains how and when services or deliverables
                will be provided to users. As this application is part of a learning and
                demonstration project, we currently do not ship any physical products.

            <h2>Digital Services Delivery</h2>
            <p>
                All services provided through this website are digital in nature.
                Any digital product, confirmation, or service access (if applicable) is
                delivered via:

                <li>Dashboard or user account access</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Delivery Timeline</h2>
            <p>
                Digital services are generally delivered instantly or within
                <strong> 1–24 hours </strong> depending on the nature of the service.
            </p>

            <h2>No Physical Shipping</h2>

            <h2>Order Confirmation</h2>

                Once a payment or request is successfully completed, you will receive a confirmation
                email on your registered email address.
            </p>

            <h2>Failed Delivery</h2>
            <p>
